> I don’t remember what cares had worn your face  
> or faded your hair from red to white — it was cancer, though,  
> that faded your lips from red to blue.  
> I can’t forget that.  
>
> I hope you don’t resent my dry eyes;  
> my graveside tears had borrowed their dust  
> from your bones. I just couldn’t try.  
> 
> And so I built you an oubliette but called it a shrine.  
> I put you inside and glorified your shining past.  
> We both forgot the road you took: Death stole the steps from you,  
> and self-indulgence hid the path from me.  
>
> I’m so sorry, Elizabeth. All the candles burn out at night,  
> the smoky censors stop their pompous puffing,  
> and only darkness kisses my dry cheeks.
