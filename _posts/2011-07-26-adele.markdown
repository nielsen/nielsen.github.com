I have a bone to pick.

Lady Gaga, I adore your music; as I have said any number of times, my fistpump is as elegant as my foxtrot, and let's be honest&mdash;you elicit my pump as well as, if not better than, most artists in your genre. However, recently you're just fucked up.

"Born This Way," the music video, was horrific. What in God's name were you thinking? Some ridiculous Creation story told to the backdrop of 1970s grotesqueries does not qualify as art. In a song that already was pandering, you've just shown yourself to be artistically bankrupt.

Because of the horrors visited upon my eyeballs by the Lady, I suddenly developed a taste for mild mannered music videos: Robyn's cheeky "Call Your Girlfriend" features a single-shot extravaganza of Robyn dancing alone in a giant warehouse, surrounded by light and rabbit fur. Adele's "Rolling in the Deep" consists of 4 memes: the beat in the water glasses (and the drummer), a ninja in a powder room, china breaking, and Adele herself.

Adele is a big woman, and she owns it, with that offensive pouf and her tight-fitting clothes; she barely moves the entire video, preferring instead to rock out in place and it is amazing.

Gaga, find your inner fat girl, and chill the fuck out.
