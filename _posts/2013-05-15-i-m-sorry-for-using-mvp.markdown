I use the term "Minimal Viable Product" a great deal when talking to product owner -- an MVP represents just enough of the application (some of which might be stubbed or dummy interfaces) to take to market (in a limited sense) and have its value validated through qualitative, heuristic research; there's the additional benefit of having its interface and workflow usability tested as well.

MVP is not "Release 1." It's not a stand-alone product. It's working software, but to the extent that the software works to _enable validated learning_.

## Why use MVPs as a tool in structuring a product build-out?

The key of using a learning-based approach is reduced enterprise risk for building an entire product -- when a company goes all-in on a product based on hypotheses, there's the very real possibility the product won't launch (because of insufficient organizational buy-in) or will launch unsuccessfully (because of low market resonance). 

A traditional Agile model is "let me write down everything you have in your head, make sure I understand it, and then we can negotiate over what actually matters and come up with a date, plan, and a dollar amount." The negotiation phases perpetuates throughout the course of building the product. 

Kickoffs and workshops for MVP-driven engagements center around the proposition that _no one_ in the room knows the answer to the question -- but there are plenty hypotheses. By providing the expertise to sort out the possibilities, strategists have the skills to enable the organization to discover the right product to build at the right time for their market.

MVPs go through a decision-point process with validated learning where the product owner can:

1. Toss it -- The market testing went so poorly, or we were so off the mark, we need to retool the approach completely. There's low realizable value for this product/feature.

1. Pivot it -- The market testing didn't go as well as planned, but we're partly there. Based on this hypothetical set of feedback, we can adjust approach, add and subtract features, and take the product back to market for re-validation. This decision point in MVP-driven projects happens the most in my experience. Sometimes, pivots are value-based and relate to specific features; sometimes, pivots are larger changes in go-to-market strategy ("We need to address a different user group with this suite of functionality."). Agile development is well-suited to pivoting, in that while there will be throw-away work, we won't be throwing the baby out with the bathwater. New approach, not a new world.

1. Double-down -- The market testing went well; if there's outstanding work around the feature set, or there's additional opportunity to capitalize on the resonance within the market, let's put it in the backlog and get goin'!

## When MVPs go south

I have seen several times that companies take the concept of MVP and, through the grand tradition of scope creep, add features and complexity -- if you find yourself on a solution-driven project where MVP is being used, don't be afraid to raise the question of whether something requires this type of learning. Scope creep transforms MVPs into releases, and by that point, the flexibility afforded by rapid change and market input is lost to the product. The investment is too big, there are too many players, etc.
