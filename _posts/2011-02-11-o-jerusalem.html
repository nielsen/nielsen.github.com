<p>Two summers ago I nearly finished a novel that bears the title of this post.  I didn't complete it for a potentially damning reason: not for laziness, but for lack of experience with the topic.</p>&#13;
<p>There was a song that was popular in my parish as a kid (I believe it was called "Jerusalem, My Destiny"), "I have fixed my eyes on your hills / Jerusalem, my destiny. / Though I cannot see the end for me, / I cannot turn away." (Of course, let us remember, "Non potest civitas abscondi supra montem posit.")  When I began to write <em>O Jerusalem</em>, there was a person in my life who inspired the theme of the novel—he was lost, and lacked, as I said to him, a Jerusalem. He had no goal. No end-game.</p>&#13;
<p>I wrote about a main character who lied and misunderstood her Jerusalem, the aimless discontent of people of a suburban neighborhood who were alive, but had the terrible fate not living.  I don't remember such effortless writing, to be fully truthful; I had that summer lost a sense innocence <em>in re</em> my friend's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_of_Aragon#The_King.27s_great_matter">Great Matter</a>, and that deflowering poured onto paper quite easily.  In the end, though, the task loomed too large for me to complete. I couldn't, when all the cards were played, make a final gambit to completion.</p>&#13;
<p>I cannot say that I pleased to say that perhaps I am now capable of finishing.</p>&#13;
<p>I don't mean to gripe, since I certainly am in the spring of my life; I'm at a wonderful company, enjoy my work, and have amazing friends. Something about India, though, has given me perspective. Last evening, the children <a href="http://sukrupa.org/">from the NGO</a> which we're working with at TWU came to the Bangalore 2 office and we had a talent show—although obviously rigged, the kids did, and should have, won.  I saw a twelve year-old who was born and raised in the slums stand up in the midst of a group of adults, some of whom were the chief executives of a massively successful corporation, and recite from memory an essay he had written about hard work and happiness. (I am still to a certain extent amazed at his wisdom, and marveled at his earnestness in wanting to be an architect and rebuild the slums.)</p>&#13;
<p>I am positive that I, who have had every imaginable opportunity in my life from parents to education to work, would have been woefully incapable of doing that at that age. Giving a portion of a presentation to that same group (most of whom are my peers) that same night was nerve-wracking at 22, and I may with total honesty observe that another decade might only mitigate that emotional tangle a touch.</p>&#13;
<p>I want to revisit the idea of having a Jerusalem because, amazingly enough, a young boy from the slums of India showed me what a city on a hill should really look like.</p>
