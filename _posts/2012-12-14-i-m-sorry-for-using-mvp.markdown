In the Solutioning Practice at TW, we use this term a great deal when talking to potential customers -- an MVP (Minimal Viable Product) is the set of features which represents just enough of the application (some of which might be stubbed or dummy interfaces) to take to market in a limited sense and have its value validated through qualitative research; there's the additional benefit of having its interface and workflow usability tested as well.

MVP is not "Release 1." It's not a stand-alone product. It's working software (stay Agile!), but to the extent that the software works to enable validated learning.

Why do we use MVPs as a tool (one of many, mind you) in structuring an engagement?

The key is around reduced enterprise risk for building an entire product -- when a company goes all-in on a product based on hypotheses, there's the very real possibility the product won't launch (because of insufficient organizational buy-in) or will launch unsuccessfully (because of low market resonance). A traditional TW inception model, as those of you who were on the Friday morning ALT call this past month heard, was "let me write down everything you have in your head, make sure I understand it, and then we can negotiate over what actually matters and come up with a date, plan, and a dollar amount." Inceptions and workshops for MVP-driven engagements center around the proposition that no one in the room knows the answer to the question -- but there are plenty hypotheses. TW provides the expertise to sort out the possibilities, and we have the skills to enable the organization to discover the right product to build at the right time for their market. We can also build it with them.

MVPs go through a decision-point process with validated learning where the client can:

1. Toss it -- The market testing went so poorly, or we were so off the mark, we need to retool the approach completely. There's low realizable value for this product/feature.

1. Pivot it -- The market testing didn't go as well as planned, but we're partly there. Based on this hypothetical set of feedback, we can adjust approach, add and subtract features, and take the product back to market for re-validation. This decision point in MVP-driven projects happens the most in my experience. Sometimes, pivots are value-based ("Customers don't use internal calendars, but they do use 3rd-party hosted ones; how about interfacing with gCal or Outlook?" h/t John Jarosz) and relate to specific features; sometimes, pivots are larger changes in go-to-market strategy ("We need to address a different user group with this suite of functionality."). Agile development is well-suited to pivoting, in that yes, there will be throw-away work sometimes, but we won't be throwing the baby out with the bathwater. New approach, not a new world.

1. Double-down -- The market testing went well; if there's outstanding work around the feature set, or there's additional opportunity to capitalize on the resonance within the market, let's put it in the backlog and get goin'!

I have seen several times that companies take the concept of MVP and, through the grand tradition of scope creep, add features and complexity -- if you find yourself on a solution-driven project where MVP is being used, don't be afraid to raise whether something is necessary to learn about. Scope creep transforms MVPs into R1, and by that point, the flexibility afforded by rapid change and market input is lost to the project. The investment is too big, there are too many players, etc.

As I said at the opening, there's a lot of material on my.TW and out in the real world on this topic (lots of folks would recommend "Lean Startup" by Eric Ries; I personally prefer "Rework" by the brains at 37Signals). Get reading and talk to RM about what's available!
