Vision and strategy are cousins, not children.

Take the vision, and fashion a strategy.

Don't showhorn it all in; if good strategy is about tradeoffs, then throwing away the right pieces of the vision in exchange for the best pieces that create a natural whole is a boon.

You're selecting the best pieces of the vision that work together synthetically.

From that subset, you craft a strategy to achieve it.

Less isn't only more, it's the only way to do it.
