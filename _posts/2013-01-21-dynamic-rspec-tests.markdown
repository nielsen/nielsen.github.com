summary: I've posted a sample over at coderwall.com on building dynamic RSpec tests. https://coderwall.com/p/5kfxhg

The [example](https://coderwall.com/p/5kfxhg) runs through the use case of bringing jBehave-like [tabular parameters](http://jbehave.org/reference/stable/tabular-parameters.html) or Cucumber [data tables](http://cukes.info/step-definitions.html#datatables-ruby) into _unit tests_ for a converter.

In the common-sense world of testing boundary conditions, I was surprised there wasn't a clean DSL for RSpec; is the use case that irregular?
