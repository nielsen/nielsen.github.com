[readwriteweb writes](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/wolfram_launches_a_new_computable_document_format.php) on the new interactive document format by Wolfram:

> This makes a "computable" document quite different than a "print" document. The information isn't fixed but can be manipulated by the reader. Unlike static formats, CDFs are "as interactive as apps, yet as everyday as documents," say Wolfram. "Central to the concept are knowledge apps, interactive diagrams, or info apps - the live successors of traditional diagrams and infographics."
