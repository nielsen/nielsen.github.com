"Don't you know who he is? He's the most important person in the world."

The movie was delicately phrased throughout, and series of snapshots and quick glimpses within the narrative of this man's humble life. A photographer who rubs shoulders with Lady Astor, and yet repairs his $5 poncho with tape - a photographer whose first request upon moving into his new apartment in Central Park South was to have all the appliances removed to make room for his extensive filing cabinets: This is the story of Bill Cunningham. 

The phrasing of the movie is the closest it came to touching narratology. There was nothing specifically sought out in the movie, no burning question that needed answering. *Bill Cunningham New York* exposed him and his life, a life of quiet moments, meetings with the high-and-mighty and anonymous alike (He calls them all "child," regardless of their age), flitting from party to party without touching food at any of them.  There was an aspect of humor at the expense of Bill, or at least, the humor reflected in his earnestness and social attitude. 

There was a brief scene when Bill was photographing at an unnamed benefit, and he was gently gesturing at a woman. She began to turn, more and more with each gesture, thinking that Bill wanted a photo of her profile. He finally beat the air a little more boldly, gesturing her _back_, so he could photograph the dress of the woman who her unremarkable white bulk was obscuring.

The audience burst into laughter at the situ, but Bill's face was fixed in study. He was absorbed in the reality of the beautiful dress back he photographed, and the faux pas missed his attention entirely.
