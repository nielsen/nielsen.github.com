summary: Dan Savage, the NYT, and fucking around.
---

Dan Savage [is profiled in the NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/03/magazine/infidelity-will-keep-us-together.html?_r=2) regarding his stance on monogamy. _Excellent_ article.

> Historically, gay men have treated monogamy more casually, in part because society treated gay coupledom as unthinkable. Now, however, gay men are marrying or entering into socially sanctioned partnerships. As they are absorbed into the mainstream of connubial bliss, they may lose the strong friendship networks that gay men once substituted for nuclear families â€” friendship networks that, according to Coontz, can make infidelity less threatening.
