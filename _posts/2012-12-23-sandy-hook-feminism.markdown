According to our dear friends at the [National Review](http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/335996/newtown-answers-nro-symposium#), by Charlotte Allen, "[A] feminized setting is a setting in which helpless passivity is the norm."

Remarkable.

In the days since the tragedy, there's been a strong amount of posturing and debate about the whither-tos and the why-fors; people point at guns, at the failure of the United States to treat mental illness... and this *fool* has chosen to point to the women teachers (some of whom were remarkably brave, like principal Dawn Hochsprung).

Let's look at the distribution of women in academic settings;:

* Women account for nearly [86%](http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/WorldStats/Gender-primary-education-teachers.html) of teachers in the US.
* However, only [60%](http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/WorldStats/Gender-secondary-education-teachers.html) of secondary education teachers.
* Even more disturbing, Harvard University with its immense endowment, can barely afford to keep the percentage of women faculty at [27%](http://harvardmagazine.com/2011/01/where-the-women-are-and-arent).
* But good news abounds: Their non-faculty staff is over half women. So, congrats, Harvard, at maintaining the secretary stereotype.

So, Ms. Allen, this "effeminizing" force in our grade and elementary schools is part of a grand tradition across industries to keep women on the tiers of the ladder (women are 98% of kindergarten teachers), while men occupy the highest levels.
