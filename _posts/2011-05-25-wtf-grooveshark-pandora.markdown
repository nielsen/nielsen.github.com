So, dear readers, for whatever reason I've resurrected my interest in [last.fm](http://last.fm). 

It's an interesting service, and it provides me an insight into my life looking back--the music I listen to in a given period of time and my moof for the same often are children of the same capricious event(s). (e.g. Oh, I must have had a bad breakup then [or] Wow, who pissed me off that week?) I stopped for a while, mostly because I found the original app quite annoying: I have to have ANOTHER window open, that does nothing but track music? It is obviously available as a background process, because I can make my current track a status on iChat.

Manical window-phobia won out over a curio.

While last.fm was on the back-burner, my use of [Grooveshark](http://listen.grooveshark.com) and [Pandora](http://www.pandora.com) spiked hugely; I love discovering new artists, especially anyone like [Melody Gardot](http://www.melodygardot.com/) or [Madeleine Peyroux](http://www.madeleinepeyroux.com/). At this point in the narrative, months later, enter an unofficial, Growl-based scrobbler, and last.fm was back in business for me.

But the services--Grooveshark (for self-curated days) / Pandora (for discovery days) vs. last.fm--are incompatable; the widgets, extensions, and iframe options out there never work for me. So, how am I supposed to track my damn music?

[doubleTwist](http://www.doubletwist.com) on my Evo scrobbles awesomely. Why can't my infinitely more expensive computer?
