<p>I don’t remember what cares had worn your face</p>&#13;
<p>or faded your hair from red to white — it was cancer, though,</p>&#13;
<p>that faded your lips from red to blue.</p>&#13;
<p>I can’t forget that.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I hope you don’t resent my dry eyes;</p>&#13;
<p>my graveside tears had borrowed their dust</p>&#13;
<p>from your bones. I just couldn’t try.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>And so I built you an oubliette but called it a shrine.</p>&#13;
<p>I put you inside and glorified your shining past.</p>&#13;
<p>We both forgot the road you took: Death stole the steps from you,</p>&#13;
<p>and self-indulgence hid the path from me.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I’m so sorry, Elizabeth. All the candles burn out at night,</p>&#13;
<p>the smoky censors stop their pompous puffing,</p>&#13;
<p>and only darkness kisses my dry cheeks.</p>
