<h2 style="margin-top: 0px;">Portfolio</h2>
   	<p>My portfolio ranges from reskinning existing websites using an iterative design process, implementing web frameworks and content management systems, to fully bespoke enterprise software.</p>

<p>I've included some of the highlights for you.</p>

<h4><a href="http://n9ne.com">N9NE Steakhouse</a></h4>
<p style="margin-top:10px">N9NE Steakhouse is one of Chicago's premier restaurants, and attracts celebrities and devote&eacute;s of excellent cuisine alike, but their style had outpaced their website: Flash-based, difficult to manage and update, and search engine impervious. They needed a redesign and technical consulting.</p>
<p style="margin-top:10px;">And so, I brought them an HTML5-compliant, seach-engine-optimized website built on a popular CMS with gallery capabilities. I deployed it with our friends over at PHPFog, and gave them instant scalability for Groupons and Gilt City deals.<p>

	<li>Version-controlled development</li>

<h4><a href="http://becerraconsulting.com">Becerra Educational Consulting</a></h4>
<p style="margin-top:10px">Becerra Educational Consulting has been one of my longest-term clients, and the custom enterprise application that I has built for them over the years our services have been retained reflects the time and effort I've poured into the app.  At the core of the e-commerce and customer relationship management application is a scheduling engine that calculates available times for classes, individual tutoring sessions, and all of their offerings from scheduled free time and already blocked off times. Every hour is tracked down to the minute for over a dozen on-going classes and many more impromptu individual sessions.</p>

<ul class="lined">
	<li>Highly available e-commerce and scheduling platform which manages client relationships.</li>
	<li>Fully custom site built on an innovative 1MB core microframework</li>
	<li>Web and print design, identity, and marketing materials</li>
</ul>

<h4><a href="http://www.roselandhospital.org">Roseland Community Hospital</a></h4>
<p style="margin-top:10px">I was brought in by the Roseland Community Hospital IT staff to integrate their web systems and give their site a visual overhaul. Information was locked in files and templates, and there was no way for the office administrators to update the information available to patients and employees.</p>

I stepped in, bringing an easy-to-use design, and worked with the IT staff to deliver a navigable and engaging site which can bear incredible resource demands by leveraging a caching plugin for Wordpress.

<h4 style="display:inline;"><a href="http://www.stockyardmagazine.com">STOCKYARD Magazine</a></h4> <small>(currently archived)</small>

<p style="margin-top:10px;">Stockyard Media approached me in Q2 of 2008 with an idea for a cultural magazine based in Chicago (my hometown!) and they needed a web presence that reflected the refinement of the brand they were building. Within two months, I had a release out the door, and by the end of a year with Stockyard Media, Inc. I had produced three design iterations of their web magazine to emphasize the social aspects of engagement, improved the processing speed of Wordpress, and architected a custom content algorithm that suggested content to a user based on a taste profile.</p>

	<li>Completely custom theme built on Wordpress</li>
	<li>Extensive plug-in development and custom content algorithm</li>
	<li>Identity and branding (logo, design, business cards, letterhead)</li>
