    <summary><![CDATA[<p>Two summers ago I nearly finished a novel that bears the title of this post.  I didn't complete it for a potentially damning reason: not for laziness, but for lack of experience with the topic.</p>&#13;
<p>There was a song that was popular in my parish as a kid (I believe it was called "Jerusalem, My Destiny"), "I have fixed my eyes on your hills / Jerusalem, my destiny. / Though I cannot see the end for me, / I cannot turn away." (Of course, let us remember, "Non potest civitas abscondi supra montem posit.")  When I began to write <em>O Jerusalem</em>, there was a person in my life who inspired the theme of the novel‚Äîhe was lost, and lacked, as I said to him, a Jerusalem. He had no goal. No end-game.</p>&#13;
<p>I wrote about a main character who lied and misunderstood her Jerusalem, the aimless discontent of people of a suburban neighborhood who were alive, but had the terrible fate not living.  I don't remember such effortless writing, to be fully truthful; I had that summer lost a sense innocence <em>in re</em> my friend's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_of_Aragon#The_King.27s_great_matter">Great Matter</a>, and that deflowering poured onto paper quite easily.  In the end, though, the task loomed too large for me to complete. I couldn't, when all the cards were played, make a final gambit to completion.</p>&#13;
<p>I cannot say that I pleased to say that perhaps I am now capable of finishing.</p>&#13;
<p>I don't mean to gripe, since I certainly am in the spring of my life; I'm at a wonderful company, enjoy my work, and have amazing friends. Something about India, though, has given me perspective. Last evening, the children <a href="http://sukrupa.org/">from the NGO</a> which we're working with at TWU came to the Bangalore 2 office and we had a talent show‚Äîalthough obviously rigged, the kids did, and should have, won.  I saw a twelve year-old who was born and raised in the slums stand up in the midst of a group of adults, some of whom were the chief executives of a massively successful corporation, and recite from memory an essay he had written about hard work and happiness. (I am still to a certain extent amazed at his wisdom, and marveled at his earnestness in wanting to be an architect and rebuild the slums.)</p>&#13;
<p>I am positive that I, who have had every imaginable opportunity in my life from parents to education to work, would have been woefully incapable of doing that at that age. Giving a portion of a presentation to that same group (most of whom are my peers) that same night was nerve-wracking at 22, and I may with total honesty observe that another decade might only mitigate that emotional tangle a touch.</p>&#13;
<p>I want to revisit the idea of having a Jerusalem because, amazingly enough, a young boy from the slums of India showed me what a city on a hill should really look like.</p>

    <summary><![CDATA[<p>Vignettes from Goa.</p>&#13;
<p>--Ted Nielsen</p>&#13;
<p>*</p>&#13;
<p>As these words cross from thought to pixel, I'm lounging on the cottage porch of a resort in Goa--freshly rinsed from the pool, indulging in a cigarette and malted beverage, and watching the stars wink at me from a sable sky. This might be the closest I've come to a moment of unadulterated relaxation.</p>&#13;
<p>* *</p>&#13;
<p>This was, to put it gently, a difficult week--long hours, endless meetings, and more "double-tapped" cups of South Indian coffee than one man ought even conceive of; the coffee machine in the second TW Bangalore office produces an excellent half cup of coffee per use.¬†</p>&#13;
<p>* * *</p>&#13;
<p>I'm waking from a vivid dream in yet another place; the life of the consultant seems unnaturally inclined toward foreign bedrooms. I need to get over that moment of confusion and irritation at expecting a more familiar ceiling.¬†</p>&#13;
<p>* * * *</p>&#13;
<p>Walking down yet another dusty avenue in this perpetually dusty country, and someone is calling me 'friend.' I give their wares a cursory glance and am unimpressed. ¬†For "original, hand-crafted" xyz, as the seller shouts after me, they seem vaguely familiar to the elephants, stonework, and drums I've seen in the other cities I've visited.</p>&#13;
<p>* * * * *</p>&#13;
<p>Salt stings the eyes, but only mildly; it's not enough to create more than a flash of pain that gets swept away in the childish enjoyment of being pushed to the shore. ¬†Shane, our Irishman, grew up near an ocean, and he seems totally at ease swimming right into the oncoming mountain of water. ¬†An effortless and fearless flip into the riptide is outside of my capacity for bravery.¬†</p>&#13;
<p>* * * * * *</p>&#13;
<p>2 nights and 1 day show me Goa's capacity for starlit serenity; reclining on the beach as surf creeps up to steal the ground from beneath my chair, I'm at a table with my colleagues, compatriots, confederates. ¬†Residents and tourists alike fill the beach with tealights and stare glass-eyed at the moon's reflection on the water. ¬†I wonder if we look like constellations to people flying through the night.</p>

<p><em>ruin</em>, n. (2) often plural, the remains of a building, typically an old one, that has suffered much damage or disintegration. From the Latin <em>ruo, ruere</em> to rush in, to fall.</p>&#13;
<p>I went this past weekend to the ruins of the not-so-ancient <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijayanagara_Empire">Vijayanagara empire</a> (14c - 17c) in northern Karnataka; Hampi was achingly beautiful, if architecturally confused: ¬†Because the Vijayanagara empire was, according to our guide Basava, rather cosmopolitan and so sought architects from every part of the not-so-ancient world, one building looked like it could be picked up and dropped next to the Trajan forum, another the Taj Mahal, and yet another the Apis at Memphis. ¬†However, all of the temples and monuments which remained after the tide of holy war in the 16th century, for all their obviously scattered cultural inspiration, were truly beautiful.</p>&#13;
<p>Ruins are, to me, a source of hope, and not despair. If impermanence is the incontrovertible fact of the human condition, then Shelley's warning in <em><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/106/246.html">Ozymandias</a></em> is irrelevant:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<pre>I MET a traveller from an antique land&#13;
Who said:‚ÄîTwo vast and trunkless legs of stone&#13;
Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,&#13;
Half sunk, a shatter'd visage lies, whose frown&#13;
And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command&#13;
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read&#13;
Which yet survive, stamp'd on these lifeless things,&#13;
The hand that mock'd them and the heart that fed.&#13;
And on the pedestal these words appear:&#13;
"My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:&#13;
Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!"&#13;
Nothing beside remains: round the decay&#13;
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,&#13;
The lone and level sands stretch far away.</pre>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>A ruin is a reminder that a culture lived as we live today - loved as fiercely, drank as deeply, warred as foolishly. I am forced as a student of the Classics to believe in the tidal power of ancient societies, because while their amenities might not have included air conditioning, their lives, as <a href="http://www.bigeye.com/donotgo.htm">Thomas</a> mused, forked lightning that illuminates the looming uncertain darkness of our own future.</p>&#13;
<p>After hearing Basava say, "This platform/pillar/room was used for parties/government" for the umpteenth time, I murmured, "These Vijayanagara kings were sure fond of bureaucracy and parties." ¬†Rebecca insightfully chimed, "Just like the Senate."¬†</p>&#13;
<p>I had a moment where I realized that our culture ‚Äì which God knows is mightily imperfect ‚Äì will always be accessible because of technology. "I survived fiestaware. I'm like the cockroach; I persist." ¬†Our 24-hour news cycles, Showtime original series, and LOLcatz paint a disappointing, and unfortunately complete, picture.</p>&#13;
<p>If ever our century rushes in, <a href="http://www.rjgeib.com/thoughts/milton/heaven-hell.html">"when Judgement Day sounds in the last trumpets / and planet and millennium both / disintegrate,"</a> I cannot conceive of a world where America, and all the twisted events following it, don't mold and shape the world.</p>&#13;

<p><em>N.B. ¬†The themes examined in the following translations are sexual in nature, as was perfectly acceptable in Roman literature, and may be too explicit for your tastes.</em></p>&#13;
<h3>1. Thesis</h3>&#13;
<p>While the bath was being drawn, the damsel was holed-up in her bedroom,<br />Scrutinizing a table with that scene painted on it‚Äî<br />The one where it‚Äôs said that Jove sends, you know,<br />A golden shower onto the bosom of Dana√´.<br />I, too, began to examine the table, and because once upon a time<br />That god had played at the same game I was playing at now,<br />I was beside myself‚Äîto have turned himself into money, and slid<br />So surreptitiously through someone else‚Äôs roof tiles, a sham<br />In the form of a shower all done to bag his broad.<br />Ah, but what a god! He who makes the highest temples of heaven tremble with his explosions!<br />Should not I, a poor little man, do the same?<br />I did it just this way and am pleased. [...]<br />Was I to let pass so great an opportunity, so brief, so hoped-for,<br />So pined-after?<br />If that were the case, I would have actually been the eunuch I was pretending to be!</p>&#13;
<p>(Translated from Terence‚Äôs¬†<em>The Eunuch</em>, Act III, Scene v)</p>&#13;
<p><img class="leftPhoto" width="220" title="Amor and Psyche" src="http://www.stockyardmagazine.com/content/articleuploads/0710/left-scandal.jpg" alt="Amor and Psyche" /></p>&#13;
<h3>2. Antithesis</h3>&#13;
<p>Hence are words learnt, hence eloquence acquired‚Äîthe greatest of necessities for outlining and inveigling your opinion. We oughtn‚Äôt to know such words as ‚Äúgolden shower,‚Äù ‚Äúbosom,‚Äù ‚Äúsham,‚Äù ‚Äúheaven‚Äôs abodes,‚Äù and others, all writ in that passage, unless Terence had introduced a lewd teenager to his audience, proposing that Jupiter was his exemplar for illicit trysts‚Äî</p>&#13;
<p>Whilst examining a certain table in her bower,<br />Where the tale was sketched<br />Of Jove‚Äôs descent in a golden shower<br />Into the bosom of Dana√´ ‚Äì a ploy to get the dame to bed.</p>&#13;
<p>And look how much he excites himself to lusty whim as if by celestial mandate:‚Äî</p>&#13;
<p>‚ÄòOh! But what a god!‚Äô spake he, ‚Äòwho sets to trembling<br />Heaven‚Äôs highest abodes with his explosions.<br />Am I, a mere mortal, not to do the same?<br />I did as much ‚Ä¶ gladly, too.‚Äô</p>&#13;

<p><em>N.B. ¬†The themes examined in the following translations are sexual in nature, as was perfectly acceptable in Roman literature, and may be too explicit for your tastes.</em></p>&#13;
<h3>1. Thesis</h3>&#13;
<p>While the bath was being drawn, the damsel was holed-up in her bedroom,<br />Scrutinizing a table with that scene painted on it‚Äî<br />The one where it‚Äôs said that Jove sends, you know,<br />A golden shower onto the bosom of Dana√´.<br />I, too, began to examine the table, and because once upon a time<br />That god had played at the same game I was playing at now,<br />I was beside myself‚Äîto have turned himself into money, and slid<br />So surreptitiously through someone else‚Äôs roof tiles, a sham<br />In the form of a shower all done to bag his broad.<br />Ah, but what a god! He who makes the highest temples of heaven tremble with his explosions!<br />Should not I, a poor little man, do the same?<br />I did it just this way and am pleased. [...]<br />Was I to let pass so great an opportunity, so brief, so hoped-for,<br />So pined-after?<br />If that were the case, I would have actually been the eunuch I was pretending to be!</p>&#13;
<p>(Translated from Terence‚Äôs¬†<em>The Eunuch</em>, Act III, Scene v)</p>&#13;
<p><img class="leftPhoto" width="220" title="Amor and Psyche" src="http://www.stockyardmagazine.com/content/articleuploads/0710/left-scandal.jpg" alt="Amor and Psyche" /></p>&#13;
<h3>2. Antithesis</h3>&#13;
<p>Hence are words learnt, hence eloquence acquired‚Äîthe greatest of necessities for outlining and inveigling your opinion. We oughtn‚Äôt to know such words as ‚Äúgolden shower,‚Äù ‚Äúbosom,‚Äù ‚Äúsham,‚Äù ‚Äúheaven‚Äôs abodes,‚Äù and others, all writ in that passage, unless Terence had introduced a lewd teenager to his audience, proposing that Jupiter was his exemplar for illicit trysts‚Äî</p>&#13;
<p>Whilst examining a certain table in her bower,<br />Where the tale was sketched<br />Of Jove‚Äôs descent in a golden shower<br />Into the bosom of Dana√´ ‚Äì a ploy to get the dame to bed.</p>&#13;
<p>And look how much he excites himself to lusty whim as if by celestial mandate:‚Äî</p>&#13;
<p>‚ÄòOh! But what a god!‚Äô spake he, ‚Äòwho sets to trembling<br />Heaven‚Äôs highest abodes with his explosions.<br />Am I, a mere mortal, not to do the same?<br />I did as much ‚Ä¶ gladly, too.‚Äô</p>&#13;
<p>For all their moral torpor, these words aren‚Äôt learnt so easily‚Äîby means of them, vileness is just done with a little less scandal. I do not accuse the words themselves, being, as they are, choice and dear vessels. Yet the wine of error is supped by us, served to us by teachers drunk on its poison; should we drink, we are thrashed, with no sober judge to whom we may appeal.

<p>I remember her funeral better than most: As a Catholic from an old Irish and German family, funerals were part of the yearly process as much as fish Fridays and allergies to the Advent wreath, but my grandmother‚Äôs funeral isn‚Äôt hued with the same cyclical colors as all the rest, black and grey suits, funeral-home navy furniture and poorly arranged flowers from people I‚Äôd never even heard of.</p>&#13;
<p>Her coffin was a masterpiece in bronze and copper, miniature Piet√†s on each corner, and a lid so polished when I stared at it, I had the eerie moment of looking at myself in a casket; the coffin shone too brightly graveside, as we read the 23rd Psalm and lowered her into the Earth. True to her wishes, we remained there until she was fully buried, and watched as a pile of dirt snuffed out the coffin‚Äôs light as quickly as a fall had snuffed out her own. It seemed an odd custom, a holdover from a time when the coffin would be lowered, the mourners move on, and then the coffin raised, body dumped, and coffin resold; as she lay dying, my grandmother would wildly grip my hand and tell me how she saw an undertaker turn in a pound of gold fillings for money at a local jeweler, her other hand covering her mouth‚Äìobscuring the details of her story‚Äìfor fear of post-mortem desecration. I thought those times had passed.</p>&#13;
<p>But they have not; you need but pass by a newsstand in Chicago to see the terrifying news: Four people are being charged with felony human dismemberment and desecration of a burial site for allegedly exhuming gravesites to resell the plots. All are employees at a Cook County graveyard in Alsip, IL, Burr Oak Cemetery‚Äîthe entire 150-acre crime scene is swamped by the grief-ridden families of the buried adults and residents of the crassly named ‚ÄúBabyland.‚Äù The national media is riddled with pictures like <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,532100,00.html">this one,</a> showing a floor covered in headstones, each one helter-skelter and carelessly tossed, the clods of dirt still clinging to them. Every news anchor excoriates the intrepid entrepreneurs for disturbing the dead, causing the city and now the FBI to focus hundreds of hours in dealing with the queries of the over 6,000 families concerned with the whereabouts of their dearly departed, including the family that failed to find 10 of their buried relatives. In the clip reel, Cook County Sheriff Thomas J. Dart is quoted often, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have an end in sight.‚Äù</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The gore from this particular situation aside, all burial ritual is not for the dead, rather it is for the living. It is the central part of the grieving process, the finality of saying good-bye by removing the person from active parts of society and relegating them to a bucolic field; it separates the person from the context of the life they led, and the act that is meant to honor the dead in memoriam is instead an act profoundly of forgetting. In a perfect world, parents are buried by mourning children, who mourn and remember until their children bury them, until those children‚Äôs children grow old and are buried too; after three and four generations, the lives which were so richly important become family heirlooms, great-great Grandma Montaigne‚Äôs fruit painting, great-great-great Grandpa von Dornenb√ºrg‚Äôs Kiste he brought with him from Germany, until the items are sold off and the stories become irrelevant. As Henry Austin Dobson quipped, ‚ÄúTime goes, you say? Ah no! / Alas, Time stays, we go,‚Äù and within the span of a few generations, no one knows the names in the family necrology, and the grieving process that was sealed graveside has been consummated.</p>&#13;
<p>What Carolyn Towns, Keith Nicks, Terrance Knicks, and Maurice Daley are accused of doing was not wrong, merely incorrect and foolhardy. I‚Äôm not critiquing their business plan, but their execution. By violating the grieving process of the living, they opened themselves to eventual exposure; had they focused their entrepreneurial efforts on the long-dead, they would have been part of a noble process of grave reclamation common in England and Germany, where space is a premium and those dead for fifty years are liable to be exhumed and cremated. In a society that cremates a projected 36% of the dead in 2010, particularly considering cremation is the perfect form of dismemberment, any American is likely to desecrate a burial site when they camp in a beautiful stretch of woods or sail on Lake Michigan. As a society, we say that it is vile, wrong, and wholly improper for these four to have done this, while we travel to museums full of artifacts from tombs; we tour through the Roman catacombs and extinguish our cigarettes on the floor, never thinking as we hypocritically throw these four into the pillory.</p>&#13;
<p>When I die, from liver failure, lung cancer, or the heart disease that plagues the men of a certain age in my family, and those I‚Äôve left behind have passed too, all that will remain of my grandmother is a few dusty photographs and the art she spent her life crafting; they won‚Äôt know about her caustic wit, how I would sit by her desk while we did crosswords, or how she made the very finest peanut butter and jelly sandwiches‚Äîand frankly, if what I pass down to them of her cannot communicate to them how positively marvelous she was, a rotten body in a plot they likely won‚Äôt want or be able to find will fail too.</p>&#13;

<p><span class="drop">F</span>rom an edifice shaped like the opening phrases of the¬†<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENP9Y79mQRA&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=BFB538B65383870A&amp;playnext=1&amp;playnext_from=PL&amp;index=2">second movement of Mahler‚Äôs Fifth Symphony</a>¬†poured even sweeter sounds when, on Wednesday, July 1, the Grant Park Music Festival marked its seventy-fifth anniversary with a gala; stretched out lazily on blankets or propped primly in wooden folding chairs, the one-thousand-person audience sat in hushed wonder as the music glided from the red and gold stage in the Jay Pritzker Pavilion, through the capable hands of conductor Carlos Kalmar, and out to the rapt lawn and the forgettably close bustle of Michigan Avenue.</p>&#13;
<p>The meme of the evening was retrospective‚Äînot only, as the Friday before, was the material for the evening rife with pieces from the period that birthed the Grant Park Music Festival in the 1930s, but the event itself was a recreation of that inaugural concert, decontextualized and transformed. When, in 1935, this same concert poured out over crowds topping fifty-thousand (according to articles cited at the concert),¬†<em>On the Beautiful Blue Danube</em>¬†was younger than some members of the audience, and the ink was still drying on Powell‚Äôs rousing¬†<em>Natchez on the Hill: Three Virginia Country Dances</em>; the audience that had thronged together in the seasonal heat of early July had listened to the music of their time in the same hushed wonder that we inherited from our ancestors seventy-five years later.</p>&#13;
<p>What links us with our fellow enthusiasts, no matter the temporal distance, cannot overcome what separates us: We are forced by the evening‚Äôs ideal to look back and realize that the origins of our experience are far less humble than its current state. Despite all the excuses the noticeable chill and forecasted rain could provide, there weren‚Äôt 49,000 people waiting at home with picnic baskets, blankets, citronella, Gouda, and Shiraz in hand, staring anxiously at the sky as their children sat glued to the computers and relayed minute-by-minute updates on the storm that would never come. When James Petrillo, as president of the Chicago Federation of Musicians and commissioner of the Chicago Park District, started providing free classical-music concerts in Grant Park in 1935, he wanted to give Chicago ‚Äúaccessible music‚Äù; and, as his tradition has been handed down over the years and memorialized in the Petrillo Music Shell, the experience has changed. Or, perhaps more disturbingly, our interpretation of the experience has changed.</p>&#13;
<p>Those crowds of the past teemed together and heard the music of their age, a happy accident of their generation‚Äôs place in history; no matter how epic the stage from which it sounds, classical music in our modern Chicago has lost the temporal relevance and connectivity that it had, in spades, when Petrillo commissioned that first concert. We must see the concert last Wednesday as an¬†<em>homage</em>, insofar as an homage lacks the charming wink of a pastiche.</p>&#13;
<p>However altered by the remove of time or lack of novelty our expectations of the Grant Park Music Festival may be, the music, despite some dubious selections that were inflicted equally on us and those first intrepid listeners in the 1930s, was stupendous. Kalmar‚Äôs sensitivity to the Wagner, Liszt, and Strauss in particular detailed the dramatic ebb and flow of each piece, fashioning them to be finer than some recordings I own; when delicate, such as the beginning of<em>Mignon</em>‚Äòs overture, his restraint was vivid as he steered the orchestra from a solo section to full sound without flaw or discernible effort.</p>&#13;
<p><span>In these moments, when the romance of Strauss‚Äôs¬†</span><em>Blue Danube</em><span>¬†has an older couple at the back of the lawn swaying softly to the music, when feet twitch in time to Liszt‚Äôs¬†</span><em>Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2</em><span>, or when even the fireworks grow quiet in awe as the¬†</span><em>Tannh√§user</em>¬†roars, the granite wall separating the one-thousand listeners of Wednesday and the fifty-thousand listeners of July 1, 1935 falls away, and art bridges our shared experience. Despite my disappointment at the lackluster turnout, for those in attendance from opening tune-up to the finale‚Äôs applause, the Grant Park Music Festival fulfilled Petrillo‚Äôs dream for music for the masses, no matter how small those masses may be.</p>

<p>You might know this one:¬†A leonine Greek boy - before an Egyptian oracle called him the son of a god, before he conquered an army that was conservatively three times the size of his own -¬†marched his army across a bridge to conquer the island stronghold of Tyre. ¬†This bridge, extending<span>¬†nearly 1 mile off-shore into the choppy¬†Mediterranean</span><span>, was the real wonder,</span><span>¬†not their victory. ¬†</span><span>I've never been one to enjoy the History Channel, but this is the stuff that over-wrought and under-funded specials are made of.</span></p>&#13;
<p>Many of you will have read the myths; a reader tastes the salt and iron of Actaeon's bitter terror as he is torn apart by his own hunting dogs. A great many may have studied the histories, trembling with anticipation at the antics of the politician whose passional speeches were more suited to a¬†Pentecostal¬†megachurch than the Roman Senate ("How much longer, Catiline, will you abuse our patience?"). ¬†And for the precious few who have spent the better third of their life to-date studying Latin, these people, real and imagined, take on the psychic proportions of the characters of fable and Mother Goose rhymes. ¬†So when I tell you that I have a man crush¬†on Alexander the Great, I ask for you to reserve judgement.</p>&#13;
<p>What I really mean to say is this: As a Classicist, I never imagined India would be the first part of his empire that I'd set foot in.¬†</p>&#13;
<p>* * *</p>&#13;
<p>A day is not so long, and in twenty-four hours I will be seeing a new night sky, vaulting over the billion souls who call India home. ¬†I remember a certain illusion I broke five years ago when I went to Ecuador, the lie that somehow in a foreign country the air will be different, or the colors more cinematic; it had been years since I had travelled farther than the Iowan homestead, and so even my memories of a foreign country - that is, any foreign country - had taken on the slightly rosy hue more appropriate for lover's musings than¬†Polaroids. But the air is just as flat, and the colors perhaps even more monochrome, eradicated by the ubiquitous Ecuadorian dust and thin equatorial sunlight.</p>&#13;
<p>I have two images of India, and only one with me in-frame. ¬†The first is built from years of movies and National Geographic, of brilliant colors and imagined spice markets. ¬†The second may be humorous to the reader, but it's quite terrifying to me; the popular term would be "too real." ¬†In <em>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</em>, a scene cuts to the elderly curator Marcus Brody wandering in a three-piece suit in some anonymous Middle Eastern marketplace, asking passers-by, "Does anyone here speak Ancient Greek?"</p>&#13;
<p>Unfortunately, where I'm going, the last people to speak Ancient Greek died with that narcissistic Greek boy.</p>
