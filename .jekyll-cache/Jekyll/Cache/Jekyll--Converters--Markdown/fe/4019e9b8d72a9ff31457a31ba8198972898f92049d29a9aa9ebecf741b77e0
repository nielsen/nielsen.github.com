Â Nudity is an unfortunate fact of sleeping, or at very least a level of dress inappropriate for the harsh sunlight and moral rectitude of India, so our hero begins the short-lived quest for his pants.

<p>â€œSweet <strong>JESUS</strong>!!â€ Â In a feat of acrobatics common among Cirque du Soleil performers, and not so common among the overweight, our hero performs a running leap to atop his mussed bed while hurling the infested garment onto the nearby chair. Â A dragon-esque centipede, the sort of bug that nightmares and Ann Rice novels are made of, iridescent and satanic red, footlong and as thick as a Sequoia, was glaring up at our hero with malevolence from the defiled innocence of a pant leg.</p>

<p><em>ruin</em>, n. (2) often plural, the remains of a building, typically an old one, that has suffered much damage or disintegration. From the Latin <em>ruo, ruere</em> to rush in, to fall.</p>

<p>I went this past weekend to the ruins of the not-so-ancient <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijayanagara_Empire">Vijayanagara empire</a> (14c - 17c) in northern Karnataka; Hampi was achingly beautiful, if architecturally confused: Â Because the Vijayanagara empire was, according to our guide Basava, rather cosmopolitan and so sought architects from every part of the not-so-ancient world, one building looked like it could be picked up and dropped next to the Trajan forum, another the Taj Mahal, and yet another the Apis at Memphis. Â However, all of the temples and monuments which remained after the tide of holy war in the 16th century, for all their obviously scattered cultural inspiration, were truly beautiful.</p>

<p>Ruins are, to me, a source of hope, and not despair. If impermanence is the incontrovertible fact of the human condition, then Shelleyâ€™s warning in <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/106/246.html"><em>Ozymandias</em></a> is irrelevant:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I MET a traveller from an antique land<br />
Who said:â€”Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br />
Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,<br />
Half sunk, a shatterâ€™d visage lies, whose frown<br />
And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command<br />
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br />
Which yet survive, stampâ€™d on these lifeless things,<br />
The hand that mockâ€™d them and the heart that fed.<br />
And on the pedestal these words appear:<br />
â€œMy name is Ozymandias, king of kings:<br />
Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!â€<br />
Nothing beside remains: round the decay<br />
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,<br />
The lone and level sands stretch far away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A ruin is a reminder that a culture lived as we live today - loved as fiercely, drank as deeply, warred as foolishly. I am forced as a student of the Classics to believe in the tidal power of ancient societies, because while their amenities might not have included air conditioning, their lives, as <a href="http://www.bigeye.com/donotgo.htm">Thomas</a> mused, forked lightning that illuminates the looming uncertain darkness of our own future.</p>

<p>After hearing Basava say, â€œThis platform/pillar/room was used for parties/governmentâ€ for the umpteenth time, I murmured, â€œThese Vijayanagara kings were sure fond of bureaucracy and parties.â€ Â Rebecca insightfully chimed, â€œJust like the Senate.â€</p>

<p>I had a moment where I realized that our culture â€“ which God knows is mightily imperfect â€“ will always be accessible because of technology. â€œI survived fiestaware. Iâ€™m like the cockroach; I persist.â€ Â Our 24-hour news cycles, Showtime original series, and LOLcatz paint a disappointing, and unfortunately complete, picture.</p>

<p>If ever our century rushes in, <a href="http://www.rjgeib.com/thoughts/milton/heaven-hell.html">â€œwhen Judgement Day sounds in the last trumpets / and planet and millennium both / disintegrate,â€</a> I cannot conceive of a world where America, and all the twisted events following it, donâ€™t mold and shape the world.</p>

<p>I imagine the Vijayanagara kings couldnâ€™t either.</p>
