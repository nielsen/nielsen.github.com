I"@<p>Turning and turning in the widening gyre</p>

<p>The falcon cannot hear the falconer;</p>

<p>Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;</p>

<p>Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,</p>

<p>The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere</p>

<p>The ceremony of innocence is drowned;</p>

<p>The best lack all conviction, while the worst</p>

<p>Are full of passionate intensity.</p>

<p>Surely some revelation is at hand;</p>

<p>Surely the Second Coming is at hand.</p>

<p>The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out</p>

<p>When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi</p>

<p>Troubles my sight: a waste of desert sand;</p>

<p>A shape with lion body and the head of a man,</p>

<p>A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,</p>

<p>Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it</p>

<p>Wind shadows of the indignant desert birds.</p>

<p>The darkness drops again but now I know</p>

<p>That twenty centuries of stony sleep</p>

<p>Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,</p>

<p>And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,</p>

<p>Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?</p>
