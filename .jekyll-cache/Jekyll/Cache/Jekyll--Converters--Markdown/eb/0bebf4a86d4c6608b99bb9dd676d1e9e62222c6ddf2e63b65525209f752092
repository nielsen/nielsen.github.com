<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t remember what cares had worn your face<br />
or faded your hair from red to white — it was cancer, though,<br />
that faded your lips from red to blue.<br />
I can’t forget that.</p>

  <p>I hope you don’t resent my dry eyes;<br />
my graveside tears had borrowed their dust<br />
from your bones. I just couldn’t try.</p>

  <p>And so I built you an oubliette but called it a shrine.<br />
I put you inside and glorified your shining past.<br />
We both forgot the road you took: Death stole the steps from you,<br />
and self-indulgence hid the path from me.</p>

  <p>I’m so sorry, Elizabeth. All the candles burn out at night,<br />
the smoky censors stop their pompous puffing,<br />
and only darkness kisses my dry cheeks.</p>
