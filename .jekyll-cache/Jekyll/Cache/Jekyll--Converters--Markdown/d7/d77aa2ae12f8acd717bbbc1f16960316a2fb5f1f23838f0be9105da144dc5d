</blockquote>

<p>You are the bread and the knife,</p>

<p>the crystal goblet and the wine.</p>

<p>You are the dew on the morning grass</p>

<p>and the burning wheel of the sun.</p>

<p>You are the white apron of the baker,</p>

<p>and the marsh birds suddenly in flight.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>However, you are not the wind in the orchard,</p>

<p>the plums on the counter,</p>

<p>or the house of cards.</p>

<p>And you are certainly not the pine-scented air.</p>

<p>There is just no way that you are the pine-scented air.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>It is possible that you are the fish under the bridge,</p>

<p>maybe even the pigeon on the generalâ€™s head,</p>

<p>but you are not even close</p>

<p>to being the field of cornflowers at dusk.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>And a quick look in the mirror will show</p>

<p>that you are neither the boots in the corner</p>

<p>nor the boat asleep in its boathouse.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>It might interest you to know,</p>

<p>speaking of the plentiful imagery of the world,</p>

<p>that I am the sound of rain on the roof.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>I also happen to be the shooting star,</p>

<p>the evening paper blowing down an alley</p>

<p>and the basket of chestnuts on the kitchen table.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>I am also the moon in the trees</p>

<p>and the blind womanâ€™s tea cup.</p>

<p>But donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™m not the bread and the knife.</p>

<p>You are still the bread and the knife.</p>

<p>You will always be the bread and the knife,</p>

<p>not to mention the crystal goblet andâ€“somehowâ€“the wine.</p>
